# OpenGL Maze Game

Interactive maze game during undergradute study at University of Surrey for the Year 2 Computer Vision & Graphics module. This repository is created for archival purpose.

The objective of this coursework is to build a 3D maze game from scratch from the provided skeleton C++ code, using the OpenGL API and Shaders. The player would control a tank and navigate it to traverse the maze while collecting all the coins, either by moving and shooting bullets. When all the coins are collected, the game advances to the next level.

The implemented game is fitted with the appropriate camera-to-world transformations, object transforms, collision detections and vertex/fragment shaders for lightings.
